**Wikidata OCI Extension** is an extension built with Wikidata API, when activated, will allow the user to select a word and click the extension to get a quick summary of the wikidata item or label selected or highlighted.

This extension operates with the action API and Wikidata's sitelinks. This [article]() is a good resource for learning more about the extension.

## How it works

The extension utilizes the Wikidata API to retrieve concise summaries of the selected text and the Wikipedia endpoint for the sitelinks URLS  

The user highlights a word on a webpage. </br>
The extension sends a request to the Wikidata API to find the matching entity. </br>
If an entity is found, the extension retrieves and displays the summary in a pop-up with their corresponding sitelinks. </br>
An Internet connection is needed for fetching data from Wikidata.

The seamless data in Wikidata OCI is possible, Thanks to the wonderful [Wikidata Action API](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php)
